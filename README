### ROS LLM Robotics Assistant ###

A ROS2 system that converts natural language tasks into safe, executable robot action plans — without requiring a real robot or simulator.

Robots are traditionally programmed using predefined task pipelines.
This project explores how modern LLM tool-calling can generate structured, safe robot plans from natural language while maintaining ROS-native execution.

It demonstrates how AI planning can integrate with real robotics software architecture — even without hardware.


# Features:
- Natural language → structured task plan (via LLM tool calling)
- Safety validation layer
- Intent grounding (prevents hallucinated locations)
- ROS-native execution pipeline
- Mocked navigation, vision, and manipulation nodes
- End-to-end execution without hardware

# Example:
- Input:
Bring a bottle to the user and put it on the table

- Generated Plan:
detect_object(bottle)
grasp(bottle)
navigate(user)
place(table)


# Safety Example
- Input:
Bring a bottle from the garage

- Result:
Blocked by safety layer (unsupported location)


# Tech Stack:
- ROS2 (rclpy)
- Python
- OpenAI Responses API (tool calling)
- Pydantic (strict schemas)
- Mocked robot services


# How to Run
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

- Run mocks:
ros2 run llm_robotics_assistant nav_node_mock
ros2 run llm_robotics_assistant vision_node_mock
ros2 run llm_robotics_assistant manip_node_mock

- Run executor:
ros2 run llm_robotics_assistant dry_run_executor

- Run planner:
ros2 run llm_robotics_assistant llm_planner_node

- Send a command:
ros2 topic pub --once /nl_command std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'Bring a bottle to the user'"


# Future Work:
- Real robot integration
- Replanning loop
- TTS feedback node
- Task memory


# Why This Project Matters:
Unlike simple LLM demos, this project:
- Uses structured tool calling instead of free text
- Applies rule-based safety validation
- Checks plan consistency with user intent
- Integrates fully with ROS messaging architecture
